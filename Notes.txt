Architecture:
Streamlit UI → Upload Document → OCR (Tesseract) → Classification → Field Extraction (Regex) → Store in SQLite → Display Results on UI


What all used here?
Frontend -  Streamlit
Optical character recognition - Tesseract OCR (via pytesseract)
PDF processing - pdf2image + poppler (converts pdfs into images for OCR)
Image Handling - pillow (PIL) [opens and preprocess image files]
Backend(document_processor.py) - includes logic of classification, extraction, processing.
Database - SQLlite 3 (stores result in a structured format)


Why I used these?
Python: supports ocr, databases and ui under a single language.
Tesseract OCR: its free, can be used offline.
pdf2image + Poppler: Simple integration in Python.
Regex(regular expression) for Field Extraction: fast, lightweight, no need to train the ml models, high accuracy on ID documents
SQL Lite Database: No server setup
Streamlit - no need for html, css, javascript


document_processor.py file - 
Reads the document (PDF or image)
If PDF → converts it to an image
Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text
Identifies document type based on text
Extracts key fields using regular expressions
Saves results (file name, type, extracted data) in SQLite
Returns the result to the Streamlit UI
